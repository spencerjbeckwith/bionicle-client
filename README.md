# BIONICLE CLIENT
Bionicle MMO set on Mata-Nui where you play as a Toa, collect your Kanohi, and face off against the Makuta.

# To-Do:
- Make atlas compile script
- Color setting per uniform per color in shader, rather than all pre-defined
    - Color and palette manager - so it'll only take one draw call to set all palette uniforms
- everything lol
